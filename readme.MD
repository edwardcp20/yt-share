**I don't really know why google has refused to allow sharing private videos using their API**

I have built this CLI tool that shares your video to emails.
You can extend its functions and improve on it.


* Since only private videos can be shared via email, the script first converts to private video.
* Update the `run.php` file and set the parameters like email, password and share_emails.
* Just two lines are written to console, login state and sharing state.
* You need to "Allow less secure apps" from this url https://myaccount.google.com/security?utm_source=OGB&utm_medium=app#connectedapps for this tool to work.


Enjoy while it lasts.
